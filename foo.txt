Hi Client, 

For building a comprehensive website for your HR consultancy, I recommend using Next.js for a responsive, SEO-friendly frontend paired with a robust backend solution powered by Node.js or Laravel. These technologies will enable seamless e-commerce integration, document management, and client-consultant dashboards.

In a recent project, I develop a service-oriented platform for a consulting firm. I designed and implemented dynamic dashboards using React and Material-UI, coupled with role-based access control to distinguish between client and consultant views. The backend was built using Express and PostgreSQL for secure, scalable data handling. The online store was seamlessly integrated using Stripe for payments, with a user-friendly interface for managing service packages and pricing updates.

To showcase case studies, I developed a section with interactive visuals and filters, enhancing user engagement and demonstrating business success stories. For document storage, secure cloud integration ensured accessibility and compliance with data protection standards.

If selected, Iâ€™ll apply industry best practices to ensure your website excels in functionality, user experience, and performance. 

Looking forward to collaborating.

Best regards,"
